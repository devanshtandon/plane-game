# 3D Plane Game

A browser-based 3D game where players control a plane to shoot down UFOs hovering over a city.

## Requirements

- 3D rendering of plane, UFOs, and city environment
- Flight controls for the plane (keyboard/mouse)
- Collision detection for projectiles and objects
- Basic physics for flight movement
- Shooting mechanics
- Explosion effects
- Game states (start, play, win, lose)
- Sound effects and background music
- Score tracking

## Tech Stack

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- JavaScript/HTML/CSS for core functionality
- Webpack for bundling
- Howler.js for sound management
- Stats.js for performance monitoring

## Milestones

### 1. Create plane model
- Implement a basic 3D plane model
- Set up initial Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- Create a basic game loop

### 2. Build city environment
- Design and implement a simple city landscape
- Add lighting and shadows
- Implement a skybox

### 3. Set up the plane controls
- Implement keyboard/mouse flight controls
- Add camera following mechanics
- Implement basic physics for realistic movement
- Add boundaries to keep the plane in the game area

### 4. Add the UFOs, shooting, and explosions
- Create UFO models and movement patterns
- Implement shooting mechanics
- Add collision detection
- Create explosion effects
- Implement scoring system

### 5. Add the music, sound effects, start, victory, and lose screens
- Implement game state management
- Create UI for start screen, victory, and lose conditions
- Add background music
- Implement sound effects for shooting, explosions, etc.
- Add final polish and optimization
